# ShopCyclops Android

The Android side of the Shopcyclops project. Shopping through another person using streaming video.

Think twitch for shopping!

Flow of the app (when secrets are included):
1. Select your delivery location on a map.
2. View available streamers in your area.
3. Join their streams and add things to their shopping carts.
4. Checkout before they checkout (guaranteeing payment for them)
5. The streamer is giving the most optimal map for their deliveries.
6. Your order is delivered to you ASAP!

The app currently has had all the secrets removed for safety.

This app ties into a server which manages streams and orders. Currently not deployed.
